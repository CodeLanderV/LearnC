# LearnC

C is a programming language that is one level above assembly.
This language is the best language to work with at system level and excelling this language gives a programmer an upper hand due to its extreme speed and complex syntax that allows the programmer to deal with system hardware level directly, which in turn also improves portability, performance and compatibility.
This repository contains very fundamental concept building c programs which on excelling, one can solve problems in C language.

- This repository has questions from Basic to high level.
- This repository contains the logic behind the code in cases of complicated programs
- happy learning!
